Welcome to the OWASP page for Security-C4PO, an open-source pentest reporting tool.
Security-C4PO is an open-source web-application for managing and documenting penetration tests.
It aims to streamline and automate the often time-consuming task of creating comprehensive reports by providing an intuitive web-based interface that facilitates the content of the [OWASP TESTING GUIDE](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/).

## Description

C4PO provides pentesters the perfect solution when it comes to reporting security vulnerabilities and other risk-related findings.
It makes the pain of copy and paste a thing of the past.
The interface is designed to guide you through your pentests in the style of the OWASP Testing Guide.
Before creating your report we show you a summary through visualizing findings and their statuses.
